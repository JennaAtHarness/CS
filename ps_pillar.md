The Reference JumpStart has two phases, a technical planning phase and technical implementation phase.  During the technical planning phase, Harness Solution Architects review customer use cases and requirements then align the customer to the Reference Architecture that is most compatible to the customer's desired outcomes. The implementation phase begins by applying our Platform Fundamentals, then concludes with the delivery of a ready-made, best practice Reference Architecture deployed directly into the customer's account, with mock systems/data to demonstrate its operation.  This Reference Architecture serves as a north star for the Customer.  They may adopt and immediately scale its design, modify and extend its design, or simply use it as a living model for further adoption. | 1-2 Weeks   | $8000   |
